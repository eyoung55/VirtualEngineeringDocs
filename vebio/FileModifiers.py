def write_file_with_replacements(filename, replacements, full_overwrite=False):

    """ Modify an existing file with replacement values.

    This function writes a modified version of an existing file with 
    replacements drawn from a user-provided dictionary.  Candidates
    for replacement are identified by the keyname provided in the dictionary,
    where the new value is stored in ``replacements[keyname]``.  It is written
    to identify variable assignments in the original file only, for example::

        double t_final = 50.0;

    would be the intended target for ``{"t_final": 25.0}`` to halve the variable
    value.  It will preserve the assignment operator for "=", ":", and " " 
    characters, where the last pattern represents any number of blank spaces.
    
    Args:
        filename (str):
            The existing file to modify.

        replacements (str):
            A dictionary of replacement values where the keyname exactly matches
            the value of a variable created with an assignment operator.

        full_overwrite (bool, optional):
            An optional argument to specify that the value associated with 
            ``replacements[keyname]`` should be used to *completely overwrite
            the matching line in the target file*, i.e., it will not attempt 
            to preserve any assignment operators, it will simply overwrite the
            target line with the value from the dictionary with no error checking.
            Defaults to ``False``.

    Returns:
        None
