# Virtual Engineering Documentation

This repo, which was created as a stopgap to publish the VE documentation via readthedocs which requires public repos, is now deprecated as the public release of Virtual Engineering was approved. The new repository, complete with documentation, can be found here: https://github.com/NREL/VirtualEngineering.  The documentation is served directly from this public repo and can be found here: https://virtualengineering.readthedocs.io/en/latest.

~~This repo serves as a public server for the VE documentation.  It includes redacted versions of the `vebio` functions so that docstrings are still captured and included.~~

~~Check out the [latest build of the documentation](https://virtual-engineering-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).~~
